## The Arduino

More about the Arduino at [arduino/Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino).

## Code

A "sketch" (of Arduino code) is commonly written using the Arduino IDE. The "Arduino Programming Language" at first glance looks similar to C and C++, but there are now numerous languages that can be compiled for Arudino use. 


## Arduino Projects

Arduino projects can range from very simple LED circuits to more complex operations involving multiple parts.


**BlinkSOS.ino**

A very simple sketch that blinks the SOS signal using the attached LED(s).


**E-robotica.ino**

Final project to demonstrate Arduino's use as a prototype Turing test by posing a question and interpreting the responder's answer.
